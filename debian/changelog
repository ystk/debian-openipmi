  * Fix pkg-config files: neither pthread.pc nor ncurses.pc exists in Debian
    (Closes: #474087)
  * Use chrpath to remove unnecessary rpath from libOpenIPMIposix.so.0.0.1
  * Remove a generated Makefile during clean to avoid it getting into the
    Debian diff after repeated builds (as seen in the Ubuntu diff)
  * Actually compile the package in build-arch rather than waiting until
    install-arch
